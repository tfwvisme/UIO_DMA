# UIO_DMA
A fairly old modification to the the Intel 82599 10 GB Ethernet custom Linux Kernel to user space Ethernet device driver as a Linux Kernel loadable module driver with custom user space hooks bypassing TCP/IP I did. I can only post kernel chnages that are open source. Qualcomms User space code is propietray. I can only show the open source Linux kernel code and IOCTL's exposed to their propietary user space code.
